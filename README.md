## Running with Docker

If you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed, you
can build and run with the `docker` command:

$ docker build . -t myserver
$ docker run -it -p 8080:3500 myserver

# Versions

## Flutter Version 3.16.5
## Dart Version Dart 3.2.3

# The Project

    This project combines the Shelf package and the Get It package.
    Shelf can be used with pure Dart to make it easier to create and compose web servers and parts of web servers.
    Get It is a simple service locator for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional extras heavily inspired by Splat.
    GetIt can be used instead of InheritedWidget or Provider to access objects, for example.

# Typical usage:

    Accessing service objects, such as REST API clients or databases, so that they can be easily mocked by accessing Views/AppModels/
Managers/BLoCs from Flutter Views

# Why GetIt?
    As your application grows, at some point you will need to put your application logic into classes that are separate from your Widgets. Avoiding widgets from having direct dependencies makes your code better organized and easier to test and maintain.
