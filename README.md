# âœ¨About The Project



Â  This project combines the Shelf package and the Get It package.

Â  Â  Shelf can be used with pure Dart to make it easier to create and compose web servers and parts of web servers.

Â  Â  Get It is a simple service locator for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional extras heavily inspired by Splat.

Â  Â  GetIt can be used instead of InheritedWidget or Provider to access objects, for example.

# ðŸ’»Typical usage:

Â  Â  Accessing service objects, such as REST API clients or databases, so that they can be easily mocked by accessing

Views/AppModels/Managers/BLoCs from Flutter Views

# ðŸ‘€Why GetIt?

Â  Â  As your application grows, at some point you will need to put your application logic into classes that are separate from your Widgets.

Â Â Â Â  Avoiding widgets from having direct dependencies makes your code better organized and easier to test and maintain.
